In graduate school, I was a TA and college instructor for several courses. I also was asked to help design a co-requisite course to help refresh students' memories of earlier coursework that was learned in a challenging, remote environment due to COVID. This repository contains some of the assignments I developed in these roles. If interested in seeing more, please let me know. I'd be happy to share!
