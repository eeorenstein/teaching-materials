In graduate school, I was a TA and college instructor for several courses. Since graduate school, I've worked as a Data Science Instructor and Curriculum Development Consultant. This repository contains some of the assignments and presentations I developed in these roles. If interested in seeing more, please let me know. I'd be happy to share!
